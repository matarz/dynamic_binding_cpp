<p>This project was a proof of concept for using dynamic binding in c++. The <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/%7Ekarlaf/CS202_Fall09/Prog2.html">assignment</a> asked that we build a program that would manage at least three devices using one common interface. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pick three high tech devices that you frequently use. Instead of re-implementing the functionality for common overlapping features, wouldnâ€™t a hierarchy be best to simulate their functionality? The best choices in technology would all have similar functionality, such as: turn on, turn off, run application, play/call,  go back, etc. Find the set of common functionality and pull it up to the common base class. Make the difference in the derived classes. &lt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we will apply inheritance and pure polymorphism to the creation of our abstraction. In the main, use a pointer to a base class  which can point to objects of any type. Avoid using casting to solve this problem. Minimize your use of if/else (or switch) as well. Attempt to use pure polymorphism as much as possible. &lt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For similar devices, I picked three smartphones (droid, iphone, nokia-n73) due to their similar functionality. Classes that are specific for each device inherit the common class which is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/matarz/dynamic_binding_cpp/blob/master/device_ABC.h">device_ABC.h</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matarz/dynamic_binding_cpp/blob/master/device_ABC.cpp">device_ABC.cpp</a>. Most of the dynamic binding "magic" can be found in main.cpp. Here is a snippet of it: 
<img src="http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/7205/20120423172159.jpg" alt="code0"></p>

<p>The variable <em><strong>i</strong></em> in the above code is a pointer of type device_ABC (base class). It is then assigned one of the three derived classes (droid, iphpne, n73) based on user choice so we can use common function calls i.e <strong>i-&gt;check_status()</strong> or <strong>i-&gt;take_pic()</strong> for all three devices without having the need to use different pointers for each class.</p>
